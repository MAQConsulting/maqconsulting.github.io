    <p class="childParaBenefit">
        We invite you to compare the benefits plan below to other staffing firms in the Pacific Northwest. In our survey, we did not find any other company that offered comparable benefits. To help you compare benefits as you look to select your next employer, consider the following:
    </p>
    <p class="subTitle">
        Paid Time Off
    </p>
    <p class="childParaBenefit">
        Our paid time off plan is simple. You accrue 10 hours of paid time off every month you work with us full time. Many other staffing firms offer limited or no paid vacation days. Some employers try to limit your use or payment for paid vacation by requiring you to complete 1000 or more service hours before you qualify for any paid vacation. Employer policies vary, so ask before you choose an employer to represent you.
    </p>
    <p class="subTitle">
        Medical And Dental Insurance
    </p>
    <p class="childParaUpper">
        Many other staffing firms offer multiple medical plans starting with a very limited plan. You as an employee have to pay extra money every month to enroll into a medical insurance plan with decent benefits.
    </p>
    <p class="childParaBenefit">
        We pay your insurance premiums in full for a comprehensive medical and dental plan. Cigna is our medical insurance provider with a great network of doctors and hospitals. Unlike other staffing firms, we do not ask you to pay to enroll into our comprehensive medical insurance plan.
    </p>
    <p class="subTitle">
        401K Retirement Plan
    </p>
    <p class="childParaBenefit">
        Most employers in the staffing industry offer a 401K retirement plan. Not all 401K plans are created equal. In our 401K retirement plan, the company matches 50% of employee contributions up to 6% of your pre-tax pay. Unlike any other company in the staffing industry that we know of, our company contributions are vested immediately. In addition, we offer over 15 low cost Vanguard funds to choose from for your 401K investments. Once your assignment ends, you can roll over the 401K plan funds to a new employer or convert to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA).
